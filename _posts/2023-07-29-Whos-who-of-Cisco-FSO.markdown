# Unveiling A New Wave of Observability: Cisco Full Stack Observability Platform

> Empowering developers and businesses with an advanced, customizable, and profit-making observability platform.

In the world of microservices, observability is the key to understanding the behavior and performance of our systems. From Jaeger's role in distributed tracing to Prometheus's efficient metrics collection, open-source tools have revolutionized how we observe our systems. But, what if we could push the boundaries even further?

Let's talk about a new platform that takes observability to the next level - a platform that binds MELT (Metrics, Events, Logs, and Traces) data to entities, provides an industry-standard customizable entity map of relationships, and empowers developers to monetize their intellectual capital.

## Unprecedented Power to Bind MELT Data to Entities

This platform goes beyond the typical metrics, logs, events, and traces. It introduces an ingenious way of binding MELT data to entities. Now, instead of sifting through a sea of independent data points, you can directly associate your MELT data with relevant entities in your system. It's like giving a name and an address to your data, making it easier to locate, interpret, and manage.

## A Customizable Entity Map Following Industry Standards

With this tool, you can visualize and customize an entity map of relationships in your system, following industry standards like Archimate. This feature brings an unprecedented level of clarity and comprehensibility to complex system architectures. Instead of spending countless hours trying to figure out how different entities are related, you can now see these relationships at a glance.

Moreover, these relationships aren't limited to just one type of association. They cover a wide range of association types, allowing you to model and understand complex inter-dependencies in your systems.

## Contextualize and Correlate Data to Enhance Problem Discovery

By leveraging the entity relationships, this platform allows users to contextualize and correlate their data. This ability to correlate data based on its context helps in reducing the time to discover issues significantly. When data from different entities is logically connected and analyzed, finding patterns, anomalies, or potential problems becomes faster and more accurate.

## Monetize Your Intellectual Capital

One of the unique benefits of this platform is that it allows developers to create and monetize their intellectual capital. Built on a flexible and robust framework, developers can build customized tools, features, or enhancements, which can be licensed with a subscription. This platform does not just provide a tool for system observability; it opens up an entirely new avenue for developers to earn from their innovations and expertise.

## The Future of Observability is Here

Cisco FDO is more than just another observability tool. It's a robust framework that binds MELT data to entities, provides a customizable entity map, enhances problem discovery, and allows developers to monetize their skills. With such a platform, the future of observability is brighter, smarter, and more profitable than ever before.
