# Unveiling A New Wave of Observability: Cisco Full Stack Observability Platform

> Empowering developers and businesses with an advanced, customizable, and monetizable observability platform.

In the world of microservices, observability is the key to understanding the behavior and performance of our systems. From Jaeger's role in distributed tracing to Prometheus's efficient metrics collection, open-source tools have revolutionized how we observe our systems. But, what if we could push the boundaries even further?

Let's talk about Cisco's FSO platform that takes observability game to the next level - a platform that binds MELT (Metrics, Events, Logs, and Traces) and provides an industry definig customizable map of relationships to empowers developers to create new experiences.

## Unprecedented Power to Bind MELT Data

This platform goes beyond the typical MELT way of analyzing your systems. It introduces a contexual model to bind MELT data to entities and relationships. Now, instead of sifting through a sea of independent data points, you can directly associate your data, reduce noise and go straight to insights.

## A Customizable Entity Map Following Industry Standards

With Cisco FSO, you can visualize and customize a schema map of relationships in your system. This feature brings an unprecedented level of clarity to complex system architectures. Instead of spending countless hours trying to figure out how different entities are related, you can now visualize these relationships at a glance.

Moreover, these relationships cover a wide range of association types, allowing you to model and understand complex inter-dependencies in your systems.

## Contextualize and Correlate

By leveraging a relationships model, this platform allows users to correlate their data. This ability helps in reducing the time to discover issues significantly. When data from different entities is logically connected and analyzed, finding patterns, anomalies, or potential problems becomes faster and more accurate.

## Create your own SaaS

One of the unique benefits of this platform is that it allows developers to create and monetize their intellectual capital. Built on a flexible and robust framework, developers can build customized tools, features, or enhancements, which can be licensed with a subscription. This platform does not just provide tools for system observability; it opens up an entirely new avenue for developers to earn from their innovations and expertise.

## The Future of Observability is Here

Cisco FSO is more than just another observability platform. It's a robust framework that binds MELT data to entities, provides a customizable entity map, enhances problem discovery, and allows developers to monetize their skills. With such a platform, the future of observability is brighter, smarter, and more profitable
