# Unveiling A New Wave of Observability: Cisco Full Stack Observability Platform

> Empowering developers and businesses with an advanced, customizable, and monetizable observability platform.

In the world of microservices, observability is the key to understanding the behavior and performance of our systems. From Jaeger's role in distributed tracing to Prometheus's efficient metrics collection, open-source tools have revolutionized how we observe our systems. But, what if we could push the boundaries even further?

Cisco's FSO platform that takes the observability game to the next level - a platform that binds MELT (Metrics, Events, Logs, and Traces) and provides an industry definig customizable way to define relationships so that developers can create new experiences.

## Unprecedented Power to Bind MELT Data

Cisco FSO platform goes beyond the typical MELT way of analyzing your systems. It introduces a contexual model to bind MELT data to entities and relationships. Now, instead of sifting through a sea of independent data points, you can directly associate your data, reduce noise and go straight to insights.

## An Entity Centric approach

With Cisco FSO, you can visualize and customize a schema map of relationships in your system. This feature brings clarity and comprehensibility to complex system architectures. Instead of spending countless hours trying to figure out how entities are related, you can now visualize these relationships at a glance.

Moreover, these relationships aren't limited to just one type of association. They cover a wide range of association types, allowing you to model and understand complex inter-dependencies in your system.

## Contextualize and Correlate

By leveraging a relationship model, this platform allows users to contextualize and correlate their data. This ability to correlate based on context helps in reducing the time to discover issues significantly. When data from different entities is logically connected and analyzed, finding patterns, anomalies, or potential problems becomes faster and more accurate.

## Create your own SaaS

One of the unique benefits of this platform is that it allows developers to create and monetize their intellectual capital. Built on a flexible and robust framework, developers can build customized tools, features, or enhancements, which can be licensed with a subscription. This opens up an entirely new avenue for developers to monetize their innovations and expertise.

## The Future of Observability

As the application landscape continues to expand and become distributed, the variance and amount of data directed towards observability systems is also increasing. There is a growing need for a developer friendly integrated platforms that take away the complexity of collecting, storing and writing queries to access data. A systems that make it easier for developers to directly build business logic and greatly reduce time to value.

Cisco FSO is more than just another observability platform. It's a robust framework that binds MELT and provides a extendable ecosystem for the developer commuinty to produce business centric applications.
